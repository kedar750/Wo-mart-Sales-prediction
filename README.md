# Problem statement: -
- Project includes data that having deatils of each stores sales , orders, how much discounts provided , based on region, based on location type.
- We need to find future sales using raw data that is provided. to do future prediciton given parameters help you to gather required sales details with respect to store, location and region. Data include holiday parameter that additionally used to see how holiday will affect on sales.

# Model Building: -
- Linear regression
- LASSO
- SGD regressor
- Random forest regressor
- Gradient boosting regressor



# Hyperparameter Tuning: -
- Random search CV

# Metric of Evaluation: â€“
- Mean Squared log error[MSLE]

# Conclusion:
- While performing with multiple model It perform well on random forest. I even check with ARIMA model however normal model perfroms better.
